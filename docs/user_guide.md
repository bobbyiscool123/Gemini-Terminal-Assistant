# Gemini Terminal Assistant User Guide

## Introduction

Gemini Terminal Assistant is a powerful AI-powered tool that helps you perform tasks directly in your terminal. Instead of remembering complex command syntax, you can simply describe what you want to do in natural language, and the assistant will help you accomplish it.

## Installation

To install the Gemini Terminal Assistant:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gemini-Terminal-Assistant.git
   cd Gemini-Terminal-Assistant
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

3. Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

4. Source your shell configuration to update your PATH:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc if using zsh
   ```

## Basic Usage

To use the assistant, simply run the `terminal-assistant` command followed by your request:

```bash
terminal-assistant "list all files in the current directory"
```

The assistant will:
1. Analyze your request
2. Plan the necessary steps
3. Execute the appropriate commands
4. Show you the results

## Advanced Features

### Command Explanation

The assistant will explain what it's doing before executing any commands, so you can learn how the commands work.

### Task Planning

For complex requests, the assistant will break down the task into smaller steps and execute them in sequence.

### Command History

Your command history is saved, making it easy to repeat or modify previous tasks.

### AI-Powered Command Generation

All commands are generated by the Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model, which means:
- No hardcoded commands - the assistant can handle any task you describe
- Automatic adaptation to your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Commands are tailored to your specific environment
- Error handling and recovery are built into the generated commands
- The assistant learns and improves with each task

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

The assistant automatically detects your operating system and generates appropriate commands:
- Uses `ls` on Linux/macOS and `dir` on Windows
- Adapts package management commands for different systems
- Handles path differences between operating systems
- Uses PowerShell when appropriate on Windows systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your Google API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Verify that your API key has access to the Gemini models

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Make sure the `terminal-assistant.sh` script is executable
   - Some commands may require sudo privileges

3. **Environment Problems**
   - If you get "command not found", ensure your PATH includes the assistant
   - Virtual environment issues can usually be fixed by running setup.py again

### Getting Help

For additional help, you can run:

```bash
terminal-assistant --help
```

Or ask the assistant directly:

```bash
terminal-assistant "how do I use terminal assistant for file management?"
```

## Customization

You can customize the assistant by editing the `config.yaml` file. This allows you to:

- Adjust the verbosity of responses
- Modify the system prompts
- Add custom command templates
- Configure safety settings

## Uninstallation

If you need to uninstall the assistant:

```bash
python uninstall.py
```

This will remove the terminal-assistant command and clean up associated files.
