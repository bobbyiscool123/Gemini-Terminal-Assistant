## Command Interception

This plugin also demonstrates how plugins can intercept and modify commands:

- Any command starting with `echo hello` will have " (plugin intercepted)" appended to it
- All successful commands will have "[Processed by hello_plugin]" added to their output

These features demonstrate how plugins can modify input and output of the terminal assistant.
